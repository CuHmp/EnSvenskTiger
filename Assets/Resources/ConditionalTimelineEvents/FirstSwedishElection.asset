    - General elections were held in Sweden on 15 September 1940. The Swedish Social
      Democratic Party remained the largest party, winning 134 of the 230 seats in
      the Second Chamber of the Riksdag. It is one of two general elections in Swedish
      history where a single party received more than half of the vote (the other
      occasion being 1968).
