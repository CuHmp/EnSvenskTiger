    - In 1st september 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, plunging europe and later
      the world into the second world war.   You, Sweden, have decided to remain
      neutral in the conflict. In order to maintain neutrality, however, you may
      need to make difficult choices in order to make sure neither the Allies, Axis
      or Soviets (Represented respectively by the flags above) dislike or like you
      too much. Should a faction like you too much, it will start to tax one of your
      resources once every 3 months. Running out of a resource will cause you to
      fail. A faction disliking you may lead to war, and you will have 6 months to
      restore the fractured relations or else lose the game.  In addition, you are
      a democratic country, and will need to face elections every four years. You
      must also make sure your popular support (on the left side of the screen) does
      not reach 0, as you will lose the game. It is now on you to lead Sweden through
      the war.
